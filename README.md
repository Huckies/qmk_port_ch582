## Overview

This is a porting of [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) keyboard firmware for CH58x series, with the main focus on bridging the application layer (QMK) and the underlying hardware.

## Directory Structure

- CherryUSB, qmk_firmware, mcuboot: Components introduced as submodules, **NO any file** is modified.

  *The qmk_firmware submodule should be able to keep up with upstream.*
- CherryUSB_porting, mcuboot_porting: Files used to configure submodules and add them into the building system.
- qmk_porting: The adapter layer for QMK to running on the CH58x chip.
- sdk: Directory for placing WCH SDK.

## Code Branches

- via: All the basic functions needed by wired keyboards are done, including VIA support. For lights, WS2812 (both SPI and PWM driven) and AW20216S (SPI driven) are supported currently.
- debug: Used for presenting specific issues, ignore if use of QMK is all you want.

## Highlights

- Support wired, Bluetooth, and triple mode 2.4G (WIP).
- Capability to update along with the QMK repo, and supports most of the features of QMK.
- Low power comsumption in wireless modes.

## Supported hardware

Currently only CH582M is tested, but it should also work for CH582F.

## Building

- A WCH-specified toolchain is provided in this repo, if you want to use the public version, you may find it [here](https://xpack.github.io/blog/2019/07/31/riscv-none-embed-gcc-v8-2-0-3-1-released). Note that you need to add it to your `PATH` environment variable manually.
- *A global defination `INT_SOFT` is needed or the ISR handlers might not working properly.*

### Keyboard manufacturers/QMK firmware users

Fork this repository then manually upload you keyboard configuration file to [keyboards](https://github.com/O-H-M2/qmk_port_ch582/tree/via/qmk_porting/keyboards). You'll be able to use the GitHub Actions to build your firmware online.

*Note that currently the configuration file is slightly different from the original QMK ones, you may take [this keyboard](https://github.com/O-H-M2/qmk_port_ch582/tree/via/qmk_porting/keyboards/m2wired) as a start point.*

### Developers

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended.

You can follow this [guide](./VSCODE_DEVELOPMENT.md) to set up a development environment locally. Or you can also use Codespace instead.

Or follow these steps below to build it on your system:

1. Install compiler and nrf command line tools:

    Download and configure the [compiler](http://mounriver.com/download) provided by WCH, and the [nrf command line tools](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-command-line-tools/download).

    - For deb-based Linux distributions users (Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu, or Ubuntu on WSL2):

        The following commands will download them from their official websites and extract the files to the `$HOME/.local/opt` directory.

        ```bash
        $ wget http://file.mounriver.com/tools/MRS_Toolchain_Linux_X64_V170.tar.xz
        $ wget https://nsscprodmedia.blob.core.windows.net/prod/software-and-other-downloads/desktop-software/nrf-command-line-tools/sw/versions-10-x-x/10-21-0/nrf-command-line-tools-10.21.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz
        $ mkdir -p $HOME/.local/opt
        $ tar xvf MRS_Toolchain_Linux_X64_V170.tar.xz -C $HOME/.local/opt
        $ tar xvf nrf-command-line-tools-10.21.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz -C $HOME/.local/opt
        ```

        Next, add these programs to your `$PATH`. For `bash` users, this can typically be accomplished by:

        ```bash
        $ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.local/opt/MRS_Toolchain_Linux_x64_V1.70/RISC-V\ Embedded\ GCC/bin/:$HOME/.local/opt/nrf-command-line-tools/bin/:$PATH' >> $HOME/.bashrc
        $ source $HOME/.bashrc
        ```

    - For macOS users:

        Download and install the nrf command line tools from [here](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-command-line-tools/download). And use the following commands to download and configure the compiler:

        ```bash
        $ curl -O http://file.mounriver.com/tools/MRS_Toolchain_MAC_V180.zip
        $ unzip MRS_Toolchain_MAC_V180.zip -d $HOME/.local/opt
        $ unzip $HOME/.local/opt/MRS_Toolchain_MAC_V180/xpack-riscv-none-embed-gcc-8.2.0.zip -d $HOME/.local/opt
        ```

        Next, add these programs to your `$PATH`. For `bash` users, this can typically be accomplished by:

        ```bash
        $ echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.local/opt/xpack-riscv-none-embed-gcc-8.2.0/bin/:$PATH' >> $HOME/.bashrc
        $ source $HOME/.bashrc
        ```

2. Install some other dependencies:

    - For deb-based Linux distributions users:

        ```bash
        $ sudo apt update
        $ sudo apt install git cmake ccache python3 python3-click python3-cbor2 python3-intelhex
        ```

    - For macOS users, assuming XCode is installed here:

        ```bash
        $ pip3 install --user cryptography click cbor2 intelhex
        ```

3. Clone this repository by:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/O-H-M2/qmk_port_ch582.git
$ cd qmk_port_ch582
$ git -c submodule."qmk_porting/keyboards_private".update=none submodule update --recursive --init
```

4. Create a directory for the building:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```

5. Running cmake for dependencies checking and generating Makefile:

```bash
$ cmake -Dkeyboard=m2wired -Dkeymap=default ..
```

You may replace `m2wired` and `default` in the above command with the names of your own keyboard and keymap.

6. Build:

```bash
$ make -j$(nproc)
```

`.uf2` and `.hex` will be generated in the top directory of the project if the build succeeds.


## Flashing

For end users: Use [Bootmagic Lite](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_bootmagic?id=bootmagic-lite) with `.uf2` only, or take your own risk of bricking your keyboard.

For developers: You may use the [flashing utility](http://www.wch.cn/downloads/WCHISPTool_Setup_exe.html) which is provided by WCH.
